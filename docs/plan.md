## Milestones
- Prototype: tokenizer, Python adapter, heuristic baseline, server, CLI, VS Code stub.
- Data: git diffs + synthetic bugfixes, evaluation harness, regression suite.
- Models: small/base configs; swap in trained checkpoints to replace the heuristic baseline.
- Production: hardened server, metrics, regression gates, multi-language adapters (JS/TS next).
